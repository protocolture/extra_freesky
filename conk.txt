EPISODE 6: REVENGE OF THE DOCUMENTATION

Stupid developer has returned to
his home planet of dumb home automation in
an attempt to integrate RPG
games with HA tools.

Little does Luke know that the
GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly
made HA tools really fucking hard 
and technology selection has become
more crucial than ever

When completed, this ultimate
weapon will spell certain doom
for the small band of rebels
struggling to restore freedom
to the galaxy...

Prerequisites. 

I have been hesitant to bother with prereqs before because the scope has been small enough that I could recall it all from memory. 

This is no longer the case. So for my benefit I will keep this section hopefully up to date. 

The project has scope creeped into amazing new areas. 

Each area will get its own subsection. 

1. Voice Assistant.

The goal here is to liberate the whole "Computer as an NPC" thing from the clutches of mechanical interaction. 

SO far this looks like:

Raspi 4
Home Automation (The tool, not the concept)
HAC - Enables extra functionality in HA 
https://github.com/jekalmin/extended_openai_conversation - Enables custom tinkering with HAC voice assistant. Allows OpenAI to interact with HA features. 

Home Automation can be installed directly from RasPi imager. 

HAC was a bitch to install so I will outline my method in detail. 

Install ADVANCED TERMINAL AND SSH addon in HA. I couldnt get the builtin one to work. 

To do this first, click on your user profile in HA, scroll down and enable Advanced Mode. 

Once you have that, install the Addon, navigate to the config window and set a username and password for SSH. 

Also make sure there are no restrictions on the Addon. 

You may need to reboot here. 

wget -O - https://get.hacs.xyz | bash -

Then

sudo reboot
